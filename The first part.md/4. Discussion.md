## 1.Brief description  
This section is discussing how I implement a visual-SLAM application.

## 2.Content
I have the following ideas on how to design a visual SLAM application. For me, ORB SLAM is a good choice because this algorithm is easy to learn and design, and the computational cost is relatively low. I plan to use Matlab code for driving to perform some steps, as Matlab is the code software I have been using the most recently. Firstly, connect the external camera to the computer so that images can be captured well on Matlab. The map is initialized using the keyframes captured by the camera. Then, the initial two keyframes and map points are stored and the location recognition database is initialized using imageviewset and worldpointset statements. The word bag method is used to perform loop detection. Then, the attributes of the map points are refined and updated, allowing for direct tracking. This allows the tracking points in the created image to move based on the camera's movement, and graphics can be drawn. After mapping and positioning, a series of inspections must be carried out to see if it meets the standards.
