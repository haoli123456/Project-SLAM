# Summary report
SLAM is not a simple knowledge for me, the time to do this project is much more than I thought. I tried my best to do this project, but I still have some problems that I can't solve. With the development of science and technology, SLAM is more closely related to our life, and it is very important for MRE students to learn this technology. SLAM can perform positioning while mapping, which is also the principle of the main technology of automatic driving. With the improvement of camera accuracy and algorithm improvement, I believe that in the near future, SLAM will be able to perform localization. Driverless cars will become the mainstream of society.
