# Project-SLAM
## The content of this project is to build a SLAM application. The function of SLAM is to build a map on which objects can be located. SLAM is mainly applied to the automatic driving of a car, where SLAM can build the surrounding environment of the car and locate the car. Therefore, after the application of SLAM, the car can follow the set path and avoid colliding with other obstacles.  
## SLAM is divided into two categories, namely visual SLAM and lidar SLAM. visual SLAM is mainly used in this project.  
## This report is divided into two parts, the first part is to research according to examples(https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/monocular-visual-simultaneous-localization-and-mapping.html), the second part is to Create a dataset about one scene by myself.
