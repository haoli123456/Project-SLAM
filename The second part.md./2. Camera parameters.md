# Camera parameters
## Because I don't have a dedicated camera, I used my phone's camera. The first step is to determine the parameters of the phone's camera, and here I used the calibrator app in Matlab I took fourteen pictures from the same location and processed them using the calibrator app to obtain the approximate parameters of the phone camera.
## Here is the picture of I use calibrator app

## Finally, i export it in the workspace of matlab
